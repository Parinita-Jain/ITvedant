What is a Window Function?

üëâ GROUP BY works on groups and reduces rows.
üëâ Window Functions work on groups too, but they don‚Äôt reduce rows ‚Äî instead, they add extra information to each row.

üí° Think of it like this:

GROUP BY = ‚ÄúTell me how much the whole class scored on average.‚Äù (class summary, fewer rows)

Window Function = ‚ÄúTell me each student‚Äôs marks, but also tell me their rank/position in the class.‚Äù (row-wise + extra info)

2. Example Dataset (IT Department Only)
emp_NAME	SALARY
Dheeraj	11000
Komal	10000
Melinda	8000
Ibrahim	8000
Vikram	8000
Vasudha	7000
Sanjay	6500
Chandni	4500
Mohan	4000
Akbar	4000
*/
#ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), DENSE_RANK()

/*
Using GROUP BY
SELECT DEPT_NAME, MAX(SALARY) AS max_salary
FROM employee
GROUP BY DEPT_NAME;


üìå Output (only summaries):

DEPT_NAME	max_salary
Admin	5000
Finance	6500
HR	8000
IT	11000

‚ö†Ô∏è Notice: You don‚Äôt see individual employees anymore, just department-level data.

2. Using Window Function
SELECT emp_NAME, DEPT_NAME, SALARY,
       MAX(SALARY) OVER (PARTITION BY DEPT_NAME) AS dept_max_salary
FROM employee;


üìå Output (all employees + dept max):

emp_NAME	DEPT_NAME	SALARY	dept_max_salary
Mohan	Admin	4000	5000
Monica	Admin	5000	5000
Gautham	Admin	2000	5000

ORDER BY SALARY DESC ‚Üí highest salary first.

ROW_NUMBER() ‚Üí unique serial no. per dept.

RANK() ‚Üí gaps if salaries tie.

DENSE_RANK() ‚Üí no gaps.
*/

/*
1. RANK()

Gives ranking with gaps when there are ties.

Example: If two employees share the same salary, they get the same rank, but the next rank is skipped.

üëâ Use RANK() when you want competition-style ranking (like sports positions).

SELECT emp_NAME, DEPT_NAME, SALARY,
       RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY DEPT_NAME ORDER BY SALARY DESC) AS rnk
FROM employee
WHERE DEPT_NAME = 'IT';

emp_NAME	SALARY	RANK
Dheeraj	11000	1
Komal	10000	2
Melinda	8000	3
Ibrahim	8000	3
Vikram	8000	3
Vasudha	7000	6

‚ö†Ô∏è Notice how rank 4 and 5 are skipped.

üìå 2. DENSE_RANK()

Gives ranking without gaps when there are ties.

Example: If three employees tie, they all get the same rank, and the next rank continues in sequence.

üëâ Use DENSE_RANK() when you want compact rankings (no skipping).

SELECT emp_NAME, DEPT_NAME, SALARY,
       DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY DEPT_NAME ORDER BY SALARY DESC) AS dense_rnk
FROM employee
WHERE DEPT_NAME = 'IT';

emp_NAME	SALARY	DENSE_RANK
Dheeraj	11000	1
Komal	10000	2
Melinda	8000	3
Ibrahim	8000	3
Vikram	8000	3
Vasudha	7000	4

‚úÖ No gaps.

üìå 3. ROW_NUMBER() (for contrast)

Just gives a unique number to each row, even if salaries tie.

Useful when you want a serial number (like picking "top 1 employee per dept").

üéØ Simple Rule of Thumb

RANK() ‚Üí Use when you want ranking like sports medals (1, 2, 2, 4).

DENSE_RANK() ‚Üí Use when you want continuous ranks (1, 2, 2, 3).

ROW_NUMBER() ‚Üí Use when you just need row numbering (no ties).

Aggregate as Window Function (vs GROUP BY)

üëâ Difference between GROUP BY and Window Function.

-- With GROUP BY (summary, loses rows)*/
SELECT DEPT_NAME, MAX(SALARY) AS max_salary
FROM employee
GROUP BY DEPT_NAME;

-- With Window Function (keeps all rows + extra info)
SELECT emp_NAME, DEPT_NAME, SALARY,

üí° GROUP BY = only one row per department.
üí° Window Function = shows every employee + their dept topper‚Äôs salary.
