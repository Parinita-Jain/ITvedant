What Is a Window Function?
A Window Function performs a calculation across a group of rows, but without collapsing them into one row (unlike GROUP BY).

It‚Äôs like saying:

‚ÄúI want to see each employee‚Äôs salary and also the average salary in their department.‚Äù



üßæ Window Function Syntax

<window_function>() OVER (
  PARTITION BY column_to_group
  ORDER BY column_to_sort
)
üîç Parts Explained:
Part	Meaning
window_function()	Like RANK(), SUM(), AVG(), etc.
PARTITION BY	Optional ‚Äì defines grouping (like GROUP BY, but keeps rows)
ORDER BY	Optional ‚Äì defines how to sort within each partition


SELECT
  emp_NAME,
  DEPT_NAME,
  SALARY,
  RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY DEPT_NAME ORDER BY SALARY DESC) AS rank_in_dept
FROM employee;

Keeps each employee row

Groups by DEPT_NAME

Orders salaries in descending order

Assigns a rank within each department

üßÆ Popular Window Functions
Function	What It Does
RANK()	Ranking with gaps (1, 2, 2, 4‚Ä¶)
DENSE_RANK()	Ranking without gaps (1, 2, 2, 3‚Ä¶)
ROW_NUMBER()	Unique number per row
SUM()	Running total
AVG()	Rolling average
LAG()	Value from previous row
LEAD()	Value from next row
NTILE(n)	Divide rows into n equal groups

üéØ Summary in Simple Words
Without Window Function	You only see individual rows
With Window Function	You see individual rows + context from group (like rank, total, etc.)
